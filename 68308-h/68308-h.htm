<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>During the past four or five years I have been
preparing a life of General McClellan in which
I plan especially to stress the political influences
behind the military operations of the first two
years of the Civil War. The main source for my
study has been the large collection of “McClellan
Papers” in the Library of Congress at Washington,
most of which hitherto never has been published.
In this collection is the manuscript
Mexican War diary and by the courteous permission
and kind cooperation of General McClellan’s
son, Professor George B. McClellan of
Princeton University, I have been able to make
the following copy. I desire to thank Professor
McClellan for other valuable help, including
the use of the daguerreotype from which the
accompanying frontispiece was made. My thanks
also are due Professor Dana C. Munro for his
timely advice and valued assistance in the preparation
of the manuscript for the press. The
map is reproduced from the “Life and Letters
of General George Gordon Meade,” with the
kind permission of the publishers, Charles Scribner’s
Sons.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[iv]</span>It has seemed to me that this diary should
prove to be of special value at the present time,
for it throws additional light upon the failure of
our time honored “volunteer system” and forecasts
its utter futility as an adequate defense in
a time of national crisis or danger.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>George Brinton McClellan was born in Philadelphia,
Pa., on December 3, 1826. He died
in Orange, N. J., on October 29, 1885. His
life covered barely fifty-nine years, his services
of national prominence only eighteen months, but
during this time he experienced such extremes of
good and ill fortune, of success and of failure, as
seldom have fallen to the lot of one man.</p>

<p>While still a small boy McClellan entered a
school in Philadelphia which was conducted by
Mr. Sears Cook Walker, a graduate of Harvard,
and remained there for four years. He later was
a pupil in the preparatory school of the University
of Pennsylvania, under the charge of Dr.
Samuel Crawford. McClellan at the same time
received private tuition in Greek and Latin from
a German teacher named Scheffer and entered
the University itself in 1840. He remained there
as a student for only two years, for in 1842 he
received an appointment to the United States
Military Academy at West Point.</p>

<p>McClellan graduated from West Point second
in his class in the summer of 1846 and was commissioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
a brevet second lieutenant of engineers.
On July 9 Colonel Joseph G. Totten, Chief of
Engineers, ordered McClellan to “repair to West
Point” for duty with the company of engineers
then being organized by Captain A. J. Swift and
Lieutenant Gustavus W. Smith. The Mexican
War had begun during the preceding May and
the young graduate of West Point was filled
with delight at the new opportunity for winning
reputation and rank in his chosen profession.
The company of engineers was ordered to Mexico
and left for the front during the month of September.</p>

<p>The diary that follows begins with the departure
from West Point and continues the narrative
of McClellan’s experiences through the battle of
Cerro Gordo in April, 1847. It ends at this
point, except for a line or two jotted down later
on in moments of impatience or ennui.</p>

<p>To the student of McClellan’s life this diary
presents certain striking contrasts in character
between the youthful soldier, not yet twenty
years of age, and the general or politician of fifteen
or twenty years later. At this time McClellan
was by nature happy-go-lucky, joyous,
carefree, and almost irresponsible. In after
years he became extremely serious, deeply and
sincerely religious, sometimes oppressed by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
sense of duty. And yet at this early age we can
plainly discern many of the traits that stand out
so prominently in his mature life. He was in
a way one of the worst subordinates and best
superiors that ever lived. As a subordinate he
was restless, critical, often ill at ease. He seemed
to have the proverbial “chip” always on his
shoulder and knew that his commanding officers
would go out of their way to knock it off; or else
he imagined it, which amounted to the same thing.
As a commanding officer he always was thoughtful,
considerate and deeply sympathetic with his
men, and they knew this and loved him for it.</p>

<p>These same traits perhaps will explain much
of the friction during the early years of the Civil
War between McClellan and Lincoln and also
the devotion that reached almost to adoration
which the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac
showed for their beloved commander. And McClellan
had many intimate friends, friends of
high character, who stood by him through thick
and thin until the very day of his death. This
relationship could not have continued strong to
the last had he not in some measure deserved it.
His integrity, his inherent truthfulness and sense
of honor, stood out predominant.</p>

<p>McClellan could write. In fact his pen was
too ready and in later years it often led him into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
difficulties. He had a keen sense of humor,
though it was tempered by too much self-confidence
and at times was tinged with conceit. He
was proud, ambitious and deeply sensitive. All
this appears in the diary, and it will be seen that
this little book offers a key to the explanation of
much that followed.</p>

<p>McClellan took a prominent and brilliant part,
for so young a man, in the later events of Scott’s
campaign which ended in the capture of the
City of Mexico. He showed himself to be
able, brave and extremely skilful. He was promoted
to the rank of brevet first lieutenant,
August 20, “for gallant and meritorious conduct
in the battles of Contreras and Cherubusco,”
and brevet captain on September 13 for his
services at Chapultepec. He was brevetted in
addition for Molino del Rey on September 8,
and the nomination was confirmed by Congress,
but he declined the honor on the ground that he
had not taken part in that battle, while this brevet
“would also cause him to rank above his commanding
officer—Lieut. G. W. Smith—who was
present at every action where he was and commanded
him.” (Ms. letter from McClellan to
General R. Jones, Adj. Gen. U. S. A., dated
“Washington City, August 1848.” <i>McClellan
Papers</i>, Library of Congress, Vol. I.)</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>The diary gives a vivid picture of Mexico,
the land and its people. Furthermore, there is
a fine description of the life of the soldiers on the
march, of the siege of Vera Cruz, and of the ill
behavior and lack of discipline of the volunteer
forces. The notes will show that General George
Gordon Meade, later the Union commander at
Gettysburg, also was a lieutenant in Taylor’s
army, and his estimate of the volunteers agrees
in every particular with that mentioned above.</p>

<p>McClellan’s career has been the subject of endless
controversy, often pursued with such acrimony
and gross unfairness that its memory
rankles today in the minds of many. Furthermore,
upon the outcome of this controversy have
depended the reputations of many prominent
men, for if McClellan should be proved to have
been in the wrong the mantle of greatness still
might rest upon the shoulders of certain politicians
and generals hitherto adjudged to be
“great.” On the other hand, if McClellan was
in the right, and the present writer believes that
in large part he was, then he was a victim of envy
and downright falsehood. His name should now
be cleared of all unjust accusations, and also
history should reverse its judgment of many of
his opponents.</p>

GEORGE B. McCLELLAN<br />


<small>1846-1847</small></h2>
</div>

<p>We left West Point on the 24th of September
1846 for General Taylor’s army in Mexico—Company
“A” Engineers<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> consisted of Captain
[A. J.] Swift, Lieutenant G. W. Smith,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> myself
and 71 rank and file. On Saturday the 26th we
sailed from the Narrows bound to Brazos de
Santiago [Texas] where we were so fortunate
as to arrive in 14 days. We had a very pleasant
passage, on the whole. Felt very much the want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
of <i>ice</i>, and <i>claret</i>. At one time could only eat
raw tomatoes.</p>

<p>The result of my experience with respect to the
transportation of troops by sea is,—</p>

<p>In the first place see that the part of the vessel
destined to receive them is thoroughly policed,
washed and well scraped out before the vessel
sails; then let a strong police party be detailed
every day, so that the part between decks may
always be well washed out and smell well. Wind-sails
are very necessary. The acting commissary
of subsistence should see for himself exactly what
is put on board for the use of the troops and
should cause a written requisition to be made
upon him for the quantity used from day to day
or week to week. He should have a reliable and
intelligent sergeant at his disposal. Care should
be taken that good cooking arrangements are
provided. Mush appeared to be a favorite and
agreeable food for the men at sea. The muskets
should be inspected every day, when the weather
permits, as also the quarters. Men must be required
to wear their worst clothes (working overalls,
etc.) on board. Care should be taken that
camp equipage and all articles necessary for immediate
use of troops when landed are so stowed
that they can be got at at once.</p>

<p>Brazos is probably the very worst port that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
could be found on the whole American coast.
We are encamped on an island which is nothing
more than a sand bar, perfectly barren, utterly
destitute of any sign of vegetation. It is about
six miles long and one-half mile broad. We are
placed about one hundred yards from the sea,
a row of sand hills some twenty feet high intervening.
Whenever a strong breeze blows the
sand flies along in perfect clouds, filling your
tent, eyes and everything else. To dry ink you
have merely to dip your paper in the sand. The
only good thing about the place is the bathing in
the surf. The water which we drink is obtained
by digging a hole large enough to contain a barrel.
In this is placed a bottomless barrel in which
the water collects. You must dig until you find
water, then “work-in” the barrel until it is well
down. This water is very bad. It is brackish
and unhealthy. The island is often overflowed
to the depth of one or two feet. To reach this
interesting spot, one is taken from the vessel in
a steamboat and taken over a bar on which the
water is six feet deep, and where the surf breaks
with the greatest violence. It is often impossible
to communicate with the vessels outside for ten
days or two weeks at a time.</p>

<p>We have been here since Monday afternoon
and it is now Friday. We expect to march for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the mouth of the Rio Grande tomorrow morning
at break of day—thence by steamboat to Matamoros
where we will remain until our arrangements
for the pontoon train are complete. We
received when we arrived the news of the battle
of Monterey. Three officers who were present
dined with us today—Nichols of the 2nd Artillery,
Captain Smith (brother of G. W. Smith)
formerly Captain of Louisiana Volunteers now
an amateur, Captain Crump of the Mississippi
Volunteers—fine fellows all. Saw Bailie Peyton
and some others pass our encampment this morning
from Monterey. I am now writing in the
guard tent (I go on guard every other day).
Immediately in front are sand hills, same on the
right, same in the rear, sandy plain on the left.
To the left of the sand hills in front are a number
of wagons parked, to the left of them a pound
containing about 200 mules, to the left and in
front of that about fifty sloops, schooners, brigs
and steamboats; to the left of that and three
miles from us may be seen Point Isabel.</p>

<p>Camp opposite Camargo,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> November 15th,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
1846. We marched from Brazos to the mouth
of the Rio Grande and on arriving there found
ourselves without tents, provisions or working
utensils, a cold Norther blowing all the time.
We, however, procured what we needed from the
Quarter Master and made the men comfortable
until the arrival of Captain Swift with the wagons,
who reached the mouth late in the afternoon,
whilst we got there about 10 A. M. Thanks to
Churchill’s kindness G. W. Smith and myself
got along very well. We left in the Corvette
the next morning (Sunday) for Matamoros,
where we arrived at about 5 P. M. The Rio
Grande is a very narrow, muddy stream. The
channel is very uncertain, changing from day to
day. The banks are covered with the mesquite
trees, canes, cabbage trees, etc. The ranches are
rather sparse, but some of them are very prettily
situated. They all consist of miserable huts built
of mesquite logs and canes placed upright—the
interstices filled with mud. The roofs are
thatched, either with canes or the leaves of the
cabbage tree (a species of palmetto). Cotton
appears to grow quite plentifully on the banks,
but is not cultivated at all. The Mexicans appear
to cultivate nothing whatever but a little
Indian corn (maize). They are certainly the
laziest people in existence—living in a rich and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
fertile country (the banks of the river at least)
they are content to roll in the mud, eat their horrible
beef and tortillas and dance all night at
their fandangos. This appears to be the character
of the Mexicans as far as I have seen, but
they will probably improve as we proceed further
in the country.</p>

<p>Matamoros is situated about a quarter mile
from the river. Some of the houses on the principal
streets are of stone, there is one near the
Plaza built in the American style with three
stories and garrets. All the rest are regular Mexican.
On the Plaza is an unfinished cathedral,
commenced on a grand scale, but unfinished from
a want of funds. The great majority of the
houses are of log. The place is quite Americanized
by our army and the usual train of sutlers,
etc., etc.,—you can get almost everything you
want there. We were encamped near the landing.
I rode over to Resaca and Palo Alto, but as there
is just now a prospect of our returning to Matamoros,
before moving on Tampico, I shall write
no description of the fields until I have visited
them again. After being sick for nearly two
weeks in Matamoros I left with the company for
Camargo on the “Whiteville,” where we arrived
two weeks ago tomorrow, and I have been in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Hospital Quarters ever since until day before
yesterday.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Now I am in camp, the wind blowing the dust
in such perfect clouds that it is perfectly horrible—one
can hardly live through it. My quarters
in Camargo were the <i>Palace</i> of Don Jesus, the
brother of the Alcalde [Mayor of the town]—he
(the Don) having absquatatated [sic]. The main
body of the <i>Palace</i> (!) is one storied. It consists
of two rooms—the smaller one occupied by Dr.
Turner, the other by “Legs” and myself (together
with Jimmie Stuart for a part of the
time). The floor is of hard earth, the walls white,
and very fancifully decorated with paintings—the
roof flat and painted green—an inscription
on it showing that “Se acabó [This house was finished]
esta casa <i>entiaso</i> [this word is not Spanish]
Dio[s] &amp;c. &amp;c. 1829.” Altogether it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
quite a recherché establishment. Jimmie Stuart
came down to take care of me when I first got
there, and after doing so with his usual kindness
was unfortunately taken with a fever, and had to
stay there anyhow.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>We are to accompany General Patterson<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to
Tampico. I hope and suppose that we will have
a fight there, then join General Taylor, <i>then</i> hey
for San Luis [Potosi] and another fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>December 5th [1846]. Mouth of the Rio
Grande. After getting up quite an excitement
about a fight at Tampico etc., we were completely
floored by the news that the navy had <i>taken</i> it
without firing a single gun<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>—the place having
been abandoned by the Mexican troops, who are
doubtless being concentrated at San Luis Potosi
in anticipation of a grand attack on the place—ah!
if we only fool them by taking Vera Cruz
and its castle, and then march on the capital—we
would have them completely. After a great
many orders and counter orders we have at length
arrived thus far on our way to Tampico. We
left Camargo on Sunday evening last (November
29th) in the corvette, with Generals Patterson
and Pillow<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and a number of other officers
(among them Captain Hunter 2nd Dragoons,
Major Abercrombie, Captain Winship, Seth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Williams,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and about a thousand volunteers).
We had decidedly a bad passage—running on
sand bars very often—being blown up against
a bank by the wind—breaking the rudder twice,
etc., etc. We left General P[atterson], Captain
Swift and many others at Matamoros. The General
started with the intention of going to Tampico
by sea—all the troops (except the Tennessee
cavalry) were to go by sea, but at Reinosa an
express overtook us ordering the General to proceed
by land with all the troops except this company,
which <i>is</i> to go by sea (!). Captain Swift
remained at Matamoros on account of his health.</p>

<p>I was perfectly disgusted coming down the
river. I found that every confounded Voluntario
in the “Continental Army” ranked me—to be
ranked and put aside for a soldier of yesterday,
a miserable thing with buttons on it, that knows
nothing whatever, is indeed too hard a case. I
have pretty much made up my mind that if I
cannot increase my <i>rank</i> in this war, I shall resign
shortly after the close of it. I cannot stand
the idea of being a Second Lieutenant all my life.
I have learned some valuable lessons in this war.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
I am (I hope and believe) pretty well cured of
castle building. I came down here with high
hopes, with pleasing anticipations of distinction,
of being in hard fought battles and acquiring a
name and reputation as a stepping stone to a
still greater eminence in some future and greater
war. I felt that if I could have a chance I could
do <i>something</i>; but what has been the result—the
real state of the case? The first thing that greeted
my ears upon arriving off Brazos was the news
of the battle of Monterey<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>—the place of all
others where this Company and its officers would
have had an ample field for distinction. There
was a grand miss, but, thank heaven, it could not
possibly have been avoided by us. Well, since
then we have been dodging about—waiting a
week here—two weeks there for the pontoon
train—a month in the dirt somewhere else—doing
nothing—half the company sick—have been sick
myself for more than a month and a half—and
here we are going to Tampico. What will be the
next thing it is impossible to guess at. We <i>may</i>
go to San Luis—we <i>may</i> go to Vera Cruz—we
<i>may</i> go home from Tampico, we <i>may</i> see a
fight, or a dozen of them—<i>or</i> we may not see a
shot fired. I have made up my mind to act the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
philosopher—to take things as they come and
not worry my head about the future—to try to
get perfectly well—and above all things to see
as much <i>fun</i> as I can “scare up” in the country.</p>

<p>I have seen more suffering since I came out
here than I could have imagined to exist. It is
really awful. I allude to the sufferings of the
Volunteers. They literally die like dogs. Were
it all known in the States, there would be no more
hue and cry against the Army, all would be willing
to have so large a regular army that we could
dispense entirely with the volunteer system. The
suffering among the Regulars is comparatively
trifling, for their officers know their duty and
take good care of the men.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>I have also come to the conclusion that the
Quartermaster’s Department is most wofully
conducted—never trust anything to that Department
which you can do for yourself. If you need
horses for your trains, etc., carry them with you.
As to provisions (for private use) get as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
as possible from the Commissaries—you get
things from them at one-half the price you pay
sutlers. Smith has ridden over to Brazos de
Santiago to endeavor to make arrangements for
our immediate transportation to Tampico. Captain
Hunter went with him on my mare. They
return in the morning. Whilst at Camargo,
Smith had a discussion with General Patterson
about his (General Patterson’s) right to order
us when en route to join General Taylor, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
orders from Head Quarters at Washington. The
General was obliged to succumb and admit the
truth of the principle “That an officer of Engineers
is not subject to the orders of every superior
officer, but only to those of his immediate
chief, and that General (or other high officer)
to whom he may be ordered to report for duty.”</p>

<p>There goes Gerber with his tattoo—so I must
stop for the present.</p>

<p>December 6th [1846]. Go it Weathercocks!
Received an order from Major McCall<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> this
morning to go back to Matamoros, as we are to
<i>march</i> to Tampico, via Victoria, with the column
under General Patterson.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Smith is away at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Brazos and if the order had been one day and
a half later we would have been off to Tampico
by sea. Have fine sea bathing here. It is blowing
very hard from the south east, so much so
as to raise the sand too much for comfort entirely.
Bee and Ward at the Brazos—coming over this
morning—will at least have an opportunity of
giving Georgie that letter of Madame Scott’s!
I feel pleased at the idea of going by land—we
will have a march to talk about, and may very
probably have a fight on the way. I firmly believe
that we will have a brush before reaching
Tampico. Unfortunately the whole column is
Voluntario.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>January 2nd, 1847. Rancho Padillo, on Soto
la Marina river. I “firmly believed” we would
have a brush!—the devil I did!—and a pretty
fool I was to think I’d have such good luck as
that. I’ve given it up entirely. But I was right
in the other—the whole column <i>is</i> Voluntario—and
a pretty column it is too. To go on with
our affairs.—We reached Matamoros on the 8th
[December] and encamped on the river bank
just below the Mexican batteries. Smith went
down to the mouth [of the river] again to select
tools for the march, leaving me in command.
After various orders and counter orders we were
finally (December 21st) directed to appear upon
the Plaza as early as possible in order to march
to El Moquete, where General Pillow was encamped
with the 3rd and 4th Illinois Volunteers.
“Mind, Mr. Smith” said the old Mustang<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the
night before, “mind and appear as early as possible,
so that you may not delay us”—all this with
that air of dignity and importance so peculiarly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
characteristic of Mustangs; well we got up at
daybreak and reached the Plaza a little after
seven, immediately reported ourselves ready to
start and were informed that we should wait for
the guide who was <i>momentarily</i> expected. We
were to march in advance, then the wagon train,
then Gibson with his artillery (a twelve pounder
field piece and twenty-four pounder howitzer)
was to bring up the rear.</p>

<p>I waited and waited in the hot sun on the
Plaza, watched the men gorging themselves with
oranges, sausages etc., them took to swearing by
way of consolation. When I had succeeded in
working myself into a happy frame of mind
(about one o’clock) old Abercrombie<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> ordered
Gibson to start in advance and our company to
bring up the rear. I wont attempt to describe
the beauties of forming a rear guard of a wagon
train. Suffice it to say that the men straggled
a great deal, some got rather drunk, all very
tired. We reached the banks of El Arroyo Tigre
about 8 o’clock (two hours after dark) and then
encamped as we best could.</p>

<p>I rode on in advance of the company to see
El Tigre and found Gibson amusing himself by
endeavoring to curse a team (a caisson) across
the river, which (the caisson, not the river—well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
<i>both were</i>, after all) had got mired in the middle.
I rode back and met the company about one mile
from the camp ground, struggling along—tired
to death and straining their eyes to see water
through the darkness. I consoled them somewhat
by telling them that it was not more than a mile
to the water, but they soon found that a mile on
foot was a great deal longer than a mile on horseback.
However, we got there at last, pitched our
camp, and soon forgot all our troubles in sound
sleep.</p>

<p>I rode in advance next morning through the
long wagon train to find a new ford. We crossed
and encamped with General Pillow’s Brigade.
Went down to Major Harris’ (4th Illinois) tent,
where I had a fine drink of brandy and the unspeakable
satisfaction of seeing a democratic Volunteer
Captain (in his shirt sleeves) sit, with
the greatest unconcern, on a tent peg for at least
an hour. Gibson and I then went to Winship’s
tent where we found G. W. [Smith] and an
invitation to dine with General Pillow.</p>

<p>During dinner it began to rain like bricks.
We adjourned to Winship’s tent, and the sight
we presented would have amused an hermit. The
water [was] about an inch deep in the tent, and
we four sitting on the bed passing around a tumbler
continually replenished from that old keg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
of commissary whiskey—oh lord! how it did fly
’round! and we were as happy a set of soldiers
as ever lived “in spite of wind and weather.”
“Whoa Winship,” says Gibson, “that’s too
strong” so he drank it all to keep us from being
injured. Well, we amused ourselves in this way
until dark—then we waded back to our respective
domiciles (is a tent a domicile?) having previously
seen old Patt make his grand entrée in
the midst of a hard rain—<i>he</i> in Dr. Wright’s<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
covered wagon (looking for all the world like an
old Quaker farmer going to market), his escort
and staff dripping with the rain. <i>We</i> wondered
why they looked so dismal and thought that it
had not been such a horrid bad day after all!</p>

<p>This evening G. W. [Smith] and myself had
a grand cursing match over an order from the
“stable” requiring a detail from our camp to
pitch and unpitch the General’s tents etc. However,
we sent them just about the meanest detail
that they ever saw. At this place our large army
was divided into two columns. We moved at
the head of the first column. General Pillow
came on one day after us.</p>

<p>We started about 7.30—a bright sunny morning.
Nothing of interest this day—the men improved
in their marching. We encamped about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
three o’clock at Guijano, where there were two
ponds of very good water. We had a beautiful
spot for our encampment, and a most delightful
moonlight evening. There is one house—hut
rather—at this place. From Matamoros to this
place the road is excellent requiring no repairs—chaparral
generally thick on roadside—one or
two small prairies—road would be boggy in wet
weather. From Matamoros to Moquete [is]
about ten miles, from El Moquete to El Guijano
about ten miles.</p>

<p>On the next day (December 24th) we marched
to Santa Teresa, a distance of 27 miles. It was
on this march that we (i. e. Songo<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>) made the
“raise” on General Patterson’s birds. He sent
us four for supper. We ate as many as we could
and had five left for breakfast—fully equal to the
loaves and fishes this. We stopped for nearly
an hour at Salina—a pond of rather bad water
about half way to Santa Teresa—what a rush
the Voluntarios made for the water! When we
arrived we found the mustang crowd taking their
lunch.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> As Songo had just then made one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
his periodical disappearances we were left without
anything to eat for some time, but at last we
descried him caracoling across the prairie on
his graceful charger. The mustangs did not have
the politeness to ask us to partake of their lunch,
but when Songo <i>did come our</i> brandy was better
than theirs anyhow. At Santa Teresa the water
was very bad—being obtained from a tancho. I
bluffed off a volunteer regiment some 100 yards
from our camp. As the Lieutenant Colonel of
this same regiment (3rd Illinois) was marching
them along by the flank he gave the command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
“by file left march!”—to bring it on the color
line. The leading file turned at about an angle
of 30 degrees. “Holloa there” says the Colonel
“you man there, you dont know how to file.”
“The h—l I dont” yells the man “d—n you, I’ve
been marching all day, and I guess I’m tired.”</p>

<p>Road good—passes principally through prairie—at
Salina wood scarce in immediate vicinity of
the water, plenty about three quarters of a mile
from it. Wood not very plenty at Santa Teresa—enough
however.</p>

<p>December 25th. We started at sunrise, and
it was a sunrise well worthy of the day. A cloud
obscured the sun at first, but it seemed a cloud
of the brightest, purest gold, and the whole east
was tinged with a hue which would defy the art
of man to imitate. It was one of those scenes
which occur but once in many years, and which
elevate us for a moment above the common range
of our thoughts. In an instant I thought of my
whole life, of the happy Christmas days of my
childhood, of my mother, of the very few others
I love—how happy Arthur and Mary<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> must
have been at that moment with their Christmas
gifts! When I was a child—as they are now—I
little thought that I should ever spend a Christmas
day upon the march, in Mexico. The time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
may come hereafter when I shall spend Christmas
in a way little anticipated by me on <i>this</i>
Christmas day. God grant that my troubles may
be as few and my thoughts as pleasant as they
were then!</p>

<p>I rode off into the prairie—followed by Songo—and
in the excitement of chasing some rabbits
managed to lose the column. I at length found
my way back, and was told that I had created
quite an excitement. When I was first seen in
the distance they did not know whether I was
a Mexican or a white man. Patt, finally concluded
that I must be a straggling “Tennessee
horse,” gave the Colonel a blowing up for allowing
his men to leave the column, and directed him
to send out a guard to apprehend the “vagrom
man.” Just about that time Smith found out
what was going on, discovered who it was and
rectified the mistake.</p>

<p>Passed Chiltipine about 11 A. M.—sent Songo
to buy eggs and milk. After we had passed about
a mile beyond the Ranche [Rancho, a hut], I
heard a peculiar neigh—which I recognized as
Jim’s—and loud laughing from the volunteers.
I turned around and saw Jim “streaking it
against time” for the mare—head up, eyes starting
and neighing at every jump, minus Songo.
I rode back to see what had become of the “faithful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Jumbo,” Jim following like a little puppy
dog. It appeared that Jim had thrown his “fidus
Achates.” When we stopped at Chiltipine Dr.
Wright gave us a drink of first rate brandy.</p>

<p>At Chiltipine (or very near there) we left the
road and took a prairie path to the left. The
grass was so high that we found ourselves at
about 1 P. M. out of sight of the train and artillery.
Pat became very much agitated and ordered
a halt, glasses were put in requisition
(brandy and spy) but no train could be discovered.
Pat became highly excited and imagined
all kinds of accidents. At last some artillery
was discovered. Pat’s excitement reached its
highest pitch, for he took it into his head that
they were Mexicans. “Good G—d, Mr. Smith!
Take your glass—take your glass—those are our
artillery or something worse! I fear they have
been cut off.” However, it turned out to be Gibson,
and Pat’s countenance changed suddenly
from a “Bluntish,” blueish, ghastly white to a
silly grin.</p>

<p>At last we reached our camp at a dirty, muddy
lake—ornamented by a dead jackass. Pat ensconced
himself in the best place with Tennessee
horse as a guard, put Gibson “in battery” on the
road, with us on his left flank—a large interval
between us and the Tennessee horse—a similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
one between Gibson and the Illinois foot. Gibson
had orders to defend the road. How he was
to be informed of the approach of the enemy
“this deponent knoweth not,” such a thing as a
picket was not thought of. I suppose Pat
thought the guns old enough to speak for themselves.</p>

<p>For our Christmas dinner we had a beefsteak
and some fried mush. Not quite so good as turkey
and mince pies, but we enjoyed it as much
as the cits at home did their crack dinners. We
finished a bottle of the Captain’s best sherry in
a marvellous short time. Songo looked as if he
thought we ought to be fuddled, but we were too
old soldiers for that. After dinner we started
off “to see Seth Williams,” but saw the mustangs
at their feed and “huevosed” the ranche. By the
bye, we thought that ordinary politeness would
have induced old Pat to have given us an invitation
to dine, but we spent our time more pleasantly
than we would have done there. We went
from Pat’s to Colonel Thomas’s, and returned
thence to Gibson, whom we found in a very good
humor, and whose Volunteer Sub-Lieutenant
(W——) was most gloriously and unroariously
[sic] corned. He yelled like a true Mohawk,
and swore that “little Jane” somebody had the
prettiest foot and hand in all Tennessee. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
set the men a most splendid example of good
conduct and quietness, but what <i>can</i> you expect
from a Volunteer? One of his ideas was first
rate—“Just imagine old Patt being attacked by
the Mexicans, and running over here in his shirt
tail—breaking thro’ the pond with old Abercrombie
after him. The d—d old fox put us here
where he thought the enemy would get us. Suppose
they should come in on the other side?
D—n him we’d see him streaking over here, with
old McCall and Abercrombie after, their shirt
tails flying, by G—d.”</p>

<p>December 26th. Marched 20 miles to San
Fernando where we arrived a little after sunset.
Road level until we arrived within about 5 miles
of San Fernando, when it became rocky and hilly
but always practicable. About 4 miles from San
Fernando we reached the summit of a hill from
which we beheld a basin of hills extending for
miles and miles—not unlike the hills between the
Hudson and Connecticut opposite West Point.
About two miles from San Fernando are some
wells of pretty good water—the men were very
thirsty—Gerber offered a volunteer half a dollar
for a canteen full of water. My little mare drank
until I thought she would kill herself. The
Alcalde and his escort met General Patterson
at this place. He was all bows, smiles and politeness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
<i>Murphy</i> of whom more anon had the honor
of taking San Fernando by storm. He was the
first to enter it, mounted on his gallant steed.
We first saw San Fernando as we arrived at the
summit of a high hill, the last rays of the sun
shining on its white houses, and the dome of the
“<i>Cathedral</i>” gave it a beautiful appearance. It
was a jewel in the midst of these uninhabited and
desert hills. We encamped in a hollow below the
town—had a small eggnog and dreamed of a hard
piece of work we had to commence on the morrow.
Mañana [tomorrow morning] por la
mañana.</p>

<p>December 27th. We had our horses saddled
at reveillé and before sunrise were upon the
banks of El Rio de San Fernando—a clear, cold
and rapid mountain stream, about 40 yards wide
and two and a half feet deep—bottom of hard
gravel. We crossed the stream and found ourselves
the first American soldiers who had been
on the further bank. The approaches to the
stream from the town required some repairs,
nothing very bad—it was horrible on the other
side. As we again crossed the stream we halted
to enjoy the beautiful view—the first rays of the
sun gave an air of beauty and freshness to the
scene that neither pen nor pencil can describe.</p>

<p>With a detail of 200 men and our own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
company we finished our work before dinner.
Walked up into the town in the afternoon. On
this day General Pillow overtook us. He had
a difficulty with a volunteer officer who mutinied,
drew a revolver on the General, etc., etc. The
General put him in charge of the guard—his regiment
remonstrated, mutinied, etc., and the matter
<i>was finally settled by the officer making an
apology</i>.</p>

<p>December 28th. Crossed the stream before
sunrise under orders to move on with the Tennessee
horse one day in advance of the column
in order to repair a very bad ford at the next
watering place—Las Chomeras. Very tiresome
and fatiguing march of about 22 miles. Road
pretty good, requiring a few repairs here and
there. Water rather brackish. Very pretty encampment.
Stream about 20 yards wide and 18
inches deep. No bread and hardly any meat for
supper.</p>

<p>December 29th. Finished the necessary repairs
about 12 noon. We partook of some kid
and claret with Colonel Thomas. While there
General Patterson arrived and crossed the
stream, encamping on the other side. Waded
over the stream to see the Generals—were ordered
to move on in advance next morning with
two companies of horse and 100 infantry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>December 30th. Started soon after daybreak
minus the infantry who were not ready. Joined
advanced guard, where Selby raised a grand
scare about some Indians who were lying in ambush
at a ravine called “los tres palos” in order
to attack us. When we reached the ravine the
guard halted and I rode on to examine it and
look for the Indians—I found a bad ravine but
no Indians.</p>

<p>On this same day the Major commanding the
rear guard (Waterhouse, of the Tennessee Cavalry)
was told by a wagonmaster that the advanced
guard was in action with the Mexicans.
The men, in the rear guard, immediately imagined
that they could distinguish the sound of
cannon and musketry. The cavalry threw off
their saddle bags and set off at a gallop—the
infantry jerked off their knapsacks and put out—Major
and all deserted their posts on the bare
report of a wagonmaster that the advance was
engaged. A beautiful commentary this on the
“citizen soldiery.” Had we really been attacked
by 500 resolute men we must inevitably have been
defeated, although our column consisted of 1700—for
the road was narrow—some men would
have rushed one way, some another—all would
have been confusion—and all, from the General
down to the dirtiest rascal of the filthy crew,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
would have been scared out of their wits (if they
ever had any).</p>

<p>Our 100 infantry dodged off before we had
done much work, and our own men did everything.
We reached Encinal about 4 P. M. after
a march of about 17 miles, and almost incessant
labor at repairs. It was on this day that <i>General</i>
Patterson sent back <i>Brigadier General</i> Pillow
to tell <i>Second Lieutenant</i> Smith to cut down a
tree around which it was impossible to go!!</p>

<p>December 31st. We left Encinal at daybreak
and arrived at about 2 P. M. at Santander, o’
Jimenez. Road good for about ten miles when
we found ourselves on the brow of a hill, some
350 feet above the vast plain, in the midst of
which was the little town of Santander. No other
indication of life was to be seen than its white
houses. The descent was very steep, the road
bad from the foot of the hill to Santander. We
had a slight stampede here, some one imagined
that he saw an armed troop approaching (which
turned out to be the Alcalde and his suite). We
passed the town, crossed the river and encamped.
Songo got 19 eggs and we had a “bust.” Colonel
Thomas turned out some whiskey to Gibson for
an eggnog—before he arrived the eggnog was
gone. I have some indistinct ideas of my last
<i>sensible</i> moments being spent in kneeling on my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
bed, and making an extra eggnog on the old
mess chest. I dont recollect whether I drank it
or not, but as the pitcher was empty the next
morning, I rather fancy that I must have done so.</p>

<p>January 1st, 1847. Woke up and found the
ridge pole <i>off</i> at one end. I rather suspect that
G. W. [Smith] must have done it by endeavoring
to see the old year out—perhaps the new one
came in via our tent, and did the damage in its
passage. We began the new year by starting
on the wrong road. After invading about two
miles of the enemies’ country we were overtaken
by an officer at full gallop, who informed us that
the column had taken another road and that we
must make our way to the front as we best could.
Smith had been informed the preceding day by
Winship (General Pillow’s Adjutant General)
that the road we took was the right one to Victoria.
We quickly discovered the magnitude of
our mistake, for we got amongst the Volunteers,
and the lord deliver us from ever getting into
such a scrape again. Falstaff’s company were
regulars in comparison with these fellows—most
of them without coats; some would have looked
much better without <i>any pants</i> than with the
parts of pants they wore; all had torn and dirty
shirts—uncombed heads—unwashed faces—they
were dirt and filth from top to toe. Such marching!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
They were marching by the flank, yet the
road was not wide enough to hold them and it
was with the greatest difficulty that you could
get by—all hollowing, cursing, yelling like so
many incarnate fiends—no attention or respect
paid to the commands of their officers, whom they
would curse as quickly as they would look at
them. They literally straggled along for miles.</p>

<p>In making a short cut through the chaparral
we came upon a detachment of <i>mounted Volunteers</i>,
amongst whom the famous Murphy, captor
of two cities, stood out predominant. He was
mounted on the “<i>crittur</i>” he had “<i>drawn</i>,” i. e.
stolen in the bushes. The beast was frisky and
full of life at first, but by dint of loading him
down with knapsacks and muskets he had tamed
him pretty well. Imagine an Irishman some six
feet, two inches high, seated on the “hindmost
slope of the rump” of a jackass about the size
of an ordinary Newfoundland dog, his legs extended
along its sides, and the front part of the
beast loaded down with knapsacks etc. Murphy
<i>steered</i> the animal with his legs, every once and
a while administering a friendly kick on the head,
by way of reminding him that <i>he</i> was thar.</p>

<p>When we crossed the San Fernando I saw a
Mexican endeavoring to make two little jackasses
cross. He was unable to do so and finally sold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
them to a Volunteer for fifty cents; the Volunteer
got them over safely. After regaling ourselves
with a view of Murphy we considered ourselves
fully repaid for the extra distance we had
marched. At last we gained our place at the
head of the column and arrived at Marquesoto
about 12 noon, without further incident—except
that General Pillow appropriated one of our big
buckets to the purpose of obtaining water from
the well. We had a very pretty ground for our
encampment and had a fine eggnog that night,
with Winship to help us drink it. From Santander
to Marquesoto about ten miles.</p>

<p>January 2nd. Started before daylight, Captain
Snead’s Company in advance. Road very
rough, covered with loose stones—could not improve
it with the means at our command. Pat
thought we might have done it—but hang Pat’s
opinion. Saw for the first time the beautiful
flower of the Spanish bayonet—a pyramid, about
two and a half or three feet high, composed of
hundreds of white blossoms. Pat immediately
began to talk about “δενδρον” this and “δενδρον”
that—and the “δενδρα” in his conservatory. San
Antonio is the place where Iturbide<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> was taken—as
Arista’s map says.... It is a large yellow
house—looking quite modern in the wilderness.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_051.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption"><small>Facsimile reproduction of McClellan’s manuscript.</small><br />

<span class="smcap">First Page of the Mexican War Diary.</span></p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>The crossing at the stream was very bad, and
required a great deal of work. Major McCall
thought it would take two days—in two days we
were at Victoria. The stream is a branch of the
Soto la Marina and is called San Antonio. It
is a clear cold stream—the banks lined with
cypress trees—the first I ever saw. Pat (after
ringing in to the owner of the ranch for a dinner)
ensconced himself in the roots of a large cypress
and with a countenance expressing mingled emotions
of fear, anxiety, impatience and disgust
watched the progress of the work—yelled at
everyone who rode into the water etc., etc.</p>

<p>January 3rd. We started before daylight and
succeeded in getting clear of the volunteer camp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
by dint of great exertions. After marching about
five miles through a fertile river bottom we
reached the main branch of the Soto la Marina,
a most beautiful stream of the clearest, coldest,
most rapid water I ever saw—about sixty yards
wide and three feet deep. Songo had some trouble
in crossing without being washed off “Jim.”</p>

<p>Padilla is situated on the banks of this stream—an
old town rapidly going to ruin—with a
quaint old Cathedral built probably 200 years
ago, if not more. After marching about twelve
miles more we reached the stream of La Corona,
another branch of La Marina, similar in its character
to the others. After working for about
an hour on the banks we encamped on the further
side. The Tennessee horse gave our men a “lift”
over both the last streams—some of the Sappers<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
had evidently never been mounted before.</p>

<p>January 4th. Very early we started for Victoria—and
had to work our way through the
camp of the Illinois regiments which was placed
along the road. At last we cleared them and
found ourselves marching by moonlight through
a beautiful grove of pecan trees. I know nothing
more pleasant than this moonlight marching,
everything is so beautiful and quiet. Every few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
moments a breath of warm air would strike our
faces—reminding us that we were almost beneath
the Tropic. After we had marched for about
four hours we heard a little more yelling than
usual among the Volunteers. Smith turned his
horse to go and have it stopped when who should
we see but the General and his staff in the midst
of the yelling. We concluded that <i>they</i> must be
yelling too, so we let them alone. This is but
one instance of the many that occurred when
these Mustang Generals were actually <i>afraid</i> to
exert their authority upon the Volunteers.—<i>Their
popularity would be endangered.</i> I have
seen enough on this march to convince me that
Volunteers and Volunteer Generals wont do. I
have repeatedly seen a Second Lieutenant of the
regular army exercise more authority over the
Volunteers—<i>officers and privates</i>—than a Mustang
General.</p>

<p>The road this day was very good and after a
march of about seventeen miles we reached Victoria.
The Volunteers had out their flags, etc.—those
that had uniforms put them on, <i>especially
the commandant of the advanced guard</i>. Picks
and shovels were put up—Generals halted and
collected their staffs, and in they went in grand
procession—evidently endeavoring to create the
impression that they had marched in this way all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
the way—the few regular officers along laughing
enough to kill themselves.</p>

<p>General [John A.] Quitman came out to meet
General Patterson—but old Zach [Taylor], who
arrived with his regulars about an hour before
we did, stayed at home like a sensible man.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> We
made fools of ourselves (not we either, for I was
laughing like a <i>wise man</i> all the time) by riding
through the streets to General Quitman’s quarters
where we had wine and fruit. Then we rode
down to the camp ground—a miserable stony
field—we in one corner of it, the “Continental
Army” all over the rest of it. We at last got
settled. About dark started over to General
Taylor’s camp. Before I had gone 200 yards
I met the very person I was going to see—need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
not say how glad I was to meet him after a two
months absence.</p>

<p>This reminds me that when at Matamoros—a
day or two before we started on the march—we
received the news of poor Norton’s death. I had
written a letter to him the day before which was
in my portfolio when I heard of his death. The
noble fellow met his death on board the Atlantic,
which was lost in Long Island Sound near New
London on the 27th November 1846. Captain
Cullum and Lieutenant C. S. Stewart were both
on board, and both escaped. Norton exerted
himself to the last to save the helpless women and
children around him—but in accordance with the
strange presentiment that had been hanging over
him for some time, he lost his own life. He was
buried at West Point—which will seem to me
a different place without him.</p>

<p>One night when at Victoria I was returning
from General Taylor’s camp and was halted
about 150 yards from our Company by a Volunteer
sentinel. As I had not the countersign I
told him who I was. He said I should not go
by him. I told him “Confound you I wont stay
out here all night.” Said he “You had no business
to go out of camp.” Said I “Stop talking,
you scoundrel, and call the Corporal of the
Guard.”—“I ain’t got no orders to call for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Corporal and wont do it—you may, though, if
you want.” “What’s the number of your post?”
“Dont know.” “Where’s the Guard tent?” “Dont
know.”—As I was debating whether to make a
rush for it, or to seek some softer hearted specimen
of patriotism, another sentinel called out to
me “Come this way, Sir!”—It appeared that the
first fellow’s post extended to one side of the
road, and the last one’s met it there.—“Come this
way, Sir” said he, “Just pass around this bush
and go in.” “Hurrah for you” said I, “you’re
a trump, and that other fellow is a good for nothing
blaguard.”</p>

<p>Left Victoria January 13th and arrived at
Tampico on the 23rd. Wednesday January 13th.
From Victoria to Santa Rosa four leagues. Road
not very hilly, but had to be cut through thick
brush; two very bad wet arroyos [gulches] were
bridged. Santa Rosa a miserable ranche—could
only get a half dozen eggs and a little pig in the
whole concern—good water <i>in the stream</i>.</p>

<p>[January] 14th. Started before daylight and
before going 200 yards we <i>landed</i> in a lake—the
road, or path, passed directly through it, and
during the rest of the day it was necessary to
cut the road through thick brush—no cart had
ever been there before. Bridged two wet arroyos
and encamped about sunset by a little stream.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Just as enough water had been procured the
stream was turned off—probably by the Mexicans.
We had a stampede this day. Rode on
about six miles with the guide. Country a perfect
wilderness—not a ranche between Santa
Rosa and Fordleone.</p>

<p>[January] 15th. Started early, road cut
through a mesquit[e] forest, many gullies, two
bad arroyos before reaching El Pastor. Here
General Twiggs<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> caught us, about 11 A. M.,
army encamped, but we went on. I worked the
road for about five miles, and started back at 4<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
[o’clock]. Smith and Guy de L....<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> rode on
about ten miles. Road better but very stony.
“Couldn’t come the cactus” over Guy de L....
this day. He (G. de L.) shot five partridges at
a shot which made us a fine supper.</p>

<p>[January] 16th. Reveillé at 3—started at 4—arrived
at end of preceding day’s work just at
daybreak. Road very stony in many places—swore
like a trooper all day—arrived at Arroyo
Albaquila about 11 [A. M.]. Twiggs came up
and helped us wonderfully by his swearing—got
over in good time—cussed our way over another
mile and a half—then encamped by the same
stream—water very good.</p>

<p>[January] 17th. Started before daybreak—road
quite good—prairie land—arrived at Fordleone
or Ferlón at about half after ten. Fine
large stream of excellent water—good ford—gravelly
bottom—gentle banks. 11 miles.</p>

<p>[January] 18th. Reveillé at 3. Started long
before daybreak—eyes almost whipped out of my
head in the dark by the branches. Crossed the
Rio Persas again at a quarter before seven—road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
rather stony in some places, but generally
good. Great many palmetto trees—beautiful
level country, covered with palmettos and cattle.
“Struck” a bottle of aguardiente, or sugar cane
rum. Made a fine lunch out of cold chicken and
rum toddy—had another toddy when we arrived
at our journey’s end. Water from a stream,
but bad.... Rode on about three miles and
found the road pretty good.</p>

<p>[January] 19th. On comparing notes at
reveillé found that the rum and polonay had made
us all sick.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Started at 5, road pretty good.
Much open land, fine pasture—great deal of cattle.
Reached Alamitos at about 9 A. M.—fine
hacienda [farm]—good water, in a stream. Had
a bottle of champagne for lunch—thanks to General
Smith. From this place to Tampico, the
principal labor consisted in making a practicable
wagon road across the numerous arroyos—most
of them dry at the time we passed: the banks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
very steep. Altamira is a pretty little town, one
march from Tampico. The road between them
passes through a very magnificent forest of live
oaks. We encamped three miles from Tampico
for about four days, and then moved into quarters
in the town—the quarters so well known as
“The Bullhead Tav<i>arn</i>.”</p>

<p>Tampico is a delightful place<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>—we passed a
very pleasant time there, and left it with regret.
We found the Artillery regiments encamped
around the city. Many of the officers came out
to meet us near Altamira. Champagne suppers
were the order of the day (night I should say)
for a long time. From Victoria to Tampico we
were detached with Guy Henry’s company of
the 3rd—and Gantt’s of the 7th—Henry messed
with us. When within about four days march
of Tampico we saw in front of us Mount Bernal,
which is shaped like a splendid dome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>We left Tampico<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> at daylight on the 24th
February [1847] on board a little schooner called
the Orator—a fast sailer, but with very inferior
accommodations. I really felt sorry to leave the
old “Bullhead Tavarn” where I had passed so
many pleasant moments. The view of the fine
city of Tampico as we sailed down the river was
beautiful. Its delightful rides, its beautiful
rivers, its lagoons and pleasant Café will ever be
present to my mind. Some of the happiest hours
of my life were passed in this same city—Santa
Anna de Tamaulipas.</p>

<p>On arriving at Lobos<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> we found that we had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
arrived a day in advance of the “Army of the
Rhine,” which had started a day before us. Lobos
is a small island formed by a coral reef—about
18 or 20 miles from the shore, forming under its
lee a safe but not very pleasant anchorage. I
went on shore but found nothing remarkable.
Some 60 vessels were there when we started. At
last the order was given to sail for Point Anton
Lizardo. We sailed next but one after the generals
and arrived before any of them except
Twiggs. We ran on the reef under the lee of
Salmadina Island, were immediately taken off
by the navy boats which put us on shore where
we were very kindly received by the Rocketeers.
It was a great relief to get rid of that confounded
red and white flag—“send a boat with an officer”—and
the disagreeable duty of reporting to the
‘Generál en Géfe’ every morning. A French
sailor of the Orator undertook to pilot us and
carried us on a reef of what he called Sacrificios<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
but what turned out to be Anton Lizardo.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>On the morning of the 9th of March we were
removed from the Orator to the steamer Edith,
and after three or four hours spent in transferring
the troops to the vessels of war and steamers,
we got under weigh and sailed for Sacrificios. At
half past one we were in full view of the town
[Vera Cruz] and castle, with which we soon were
to be very intimately acquainted.</p>

<p>Shortly after anchoring the preparations for
landing commenced, and the 1st (Worth’s)<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Brigade was formed in tow of the “Princeton”
in two long lines of surf boats—bayonets fixed
and colors flying. At last all was ready, but just
before the order was given to cast off a shot
whistled over our heads. “Here it comes” thought
everybody, “now we will catch it.” When the
order was given the boats cast off and forming
in three parallel lines pulled for the shore, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
a word was said—everyone expected to hear and
feel their batteries open every instant. Still we
pulled on and on—until at last when the first
boats struck the shore those behind, in the fleet,
raised that same cheer which has echoed on all
our battlefields—we took it up and such cheering
I never expect to hear again—except on the field
of battle.</p>

<p>Without waiting for the boats to strike the
men jumped in up to their middles in the water
and the battalions formed on their colors in an
instant—our company was the right of the reserve
under [Lieut.-] Colonel Belton. Our company
and the 3rd Artillery ascended the sand
hills and saw—<i>nothing</i>. We slept in the sand—wet
to the middle. In the middle of the night
we were awakened by musketry—a skirmish between
some pickets. The next morning we were
sent to unload and reload the “red iron boat”—after
which we resumed our position and took our
place in the line of investment. Before we commenced
the investment, the whole army was
drawn up on the beach. We took up our position
on a line of sand hills about two miles from
the town. The Mexicans amused themselves by
firing shot and shells at us—all of which (with
one exception) fell short.</p>

<p>The sun was most intensely hot, and there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
not a particle of vegetation on the sand hills which
we occupied. Captain Swift found himself unable
to stand it, and at about half past twelve
gave up the command to G. W. Smith and went
on board the “Massachusetts” that same afternoon.
He did not resume the command, but returned
to the United States. He died in New
Orleans on the 24th of April.</p>

<p>About one we were ordered to open a road to
Malibran (a ruined monastery at the head of
the lagoon). The Mohawks had been skirmishing
around there, but, as I was afterward informed
by some of their officers, that they fired
more on each other than on the Mexicans. After
cutting the road to Malibran we continued it as
far as the railroad—a party of Volunteers doing
the work and some 25 of our men acting as a
guard. When we arrived at the railroad, we
found it and the chaparral occupied by the Mexicans.
<i>Our</i> men had a skirmish with them—charged
the chaparral and drove them out of it.</p>

<p>We returned to Malibran and bivouacked on
the wet grass without fires—hardly anything to
eat—wet and cold. Got up in the morning and
resumed our work on the road—from the railroad
to the “high bare sand hill”—occupied by the
Pennsylvanians the night before. The work was
very tedious, tiresome and difficult—the hill very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
high and steep—and the work not at all facilitated
by the shells and shot that continually fell
all around us. At last we cut our way to the
summit—tired to death. A M—— rifleman was
killed this morning by a 24 pound shot—on top
of the hill. Lieutenant Colonel Dickenson and
some few Volunteers were wounded by escopette<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
balls.</p>

<p>I was sent up in the morning to find the best
path for our road and just as I got up to the top
of the hill the bullets commenced whistling like
hail around me. Some Lancers<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> were firing at
the Volunteers—who were very much confused
and did not behave well. Taylor’s Battery and
the rest of Twiggs’s Division moved over the hill
towards their position on the left of the line.
Worth’s Division (or Brigade as it was then
called) occupied the right of the investment, the
Mohawks under Patterson the centre, and
Twiggs the left. After resting our men at Malibran,
we moved back to our old position with the
3rd Artillery, where we bivouacked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>I had observed on the preceding day the position
of the aqueduct supplying the city with
water. I told Lieutenant Beauregard<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> next
morning what I had seen. He reported it to
Colonel [Joseph G.] Totten [Chief of Engineers]
and Smith and myself were ordered to
cut off the water, Foster remaining at home. We
took a party, cut off the water, Smith exploded
a humbug of Gid Pillow’s and we started on a
reconnoitring expedition of our own. I stopped
to kill a “slow deer” and Smith went on. I then
followed him with three men and overtook him
a little this side of the cemetery. We went on
to within 900 yards of the city and at least a mile
and a half in advance of the line of investment—ascertained
the general formation of the ground
and where to reconnoitre. We returned after
dark, Foster much troubled as to what had become
of us. It was upon reporting to Colonel
Totten on this night (12th) that he said that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
and G. W. [Smith] were the only officers who
had as yet given him any information of value—that
we had done more than all the rest, etc., etc.
All forgotten with the words as they left his
mouth—vide his official report of the siege. G.
W. and myself will never forget how we passed
this blessed night—(new fashioned dance).</p>

<p>On the next day Foster was sent after our baggage
and camp equipage. I was ordered to move
the company and pitch the tents on a spot on the
extreme right. Smith went out with Major
[John L.] Smith to where we had been the night
before, but went no further toward the city than
we had been.</p>

<p>[March 14th]. The next day Foster was detailed
to assist Major Smith and Beauregard in
measuring a base line etc. on the sand hills.
G. W. and myself went to the lime kiln in the
morning, where we saw Captain [John R.] Vinton,
Van Vliet, Laing, Rodgers and Wilcox
(Cadmus)—took a good look at the town and its
defences—and determined to go along the ridge
by the cemetery that night and to go nearer the
city. While at the lime kiln an order was received
from General Worth informing Captain
Vinton that the enemy’s picquets would be driven
in that day and that <i>he</i> (Captain Vinton) must
not attempt to support them—as there were
strong reserves.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>We returned to camp, got our dinner and
started again—being a little fearful that our
picquets would be so far advanced as to interfere
with our operations. But we found them about
150 yards in advance of the line of investment,
stooping, whispering, and acting as if they expected
to be fired upon every moment—whilst
we had been a mile and a half in advance of their
position with a dozen men. They were at first
disposed to dissuade us from going on—as being
too dangerous etc. We went on though, accompanied
by Captain Walker of the 6th. The Captain
left us before we got to the cemetery. I
took one man (Sergeant Starr) and went down
to reconnoitre it—in order to ascertain whether
it was occupied by the enemy, whilst G. W.
[Smith] went on to examine a hill which covered
the valley from Santiago and the Castle to some
extent. I went down to the cemetery (finding
a good road) went around it and got in it—satisfying
myself that it was not occupied. I rejoined
G. W. and together we went on very near the
town. We returned late, being the only officers
of any corps who had gone as far as, much less
beyond the cemetery.</p>

<p>[March] 15th. The next day we were ordered
to cut an infantry road as far as the cemetery.
We found that one had been cut before we got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
out by Captain Johnson as far as the old grave
yard. We cut one completely concealed from
view from there to the hollow immediately opposite
the cemetery. Captain Walker’s company
was behind the cemetery. Whilst there one of
his sentinels reported the approach of some
Lancers. They stopped at a house about 30
yards from the other side of the cemetery—and
came no farther. On the strength of the approach
of these 15 or 20 Lancers a report got
back to camp that the advanced picquets had been
attacked by a strong force of Mexicans—so on
our return we met nearly the whole division
marching out to drive them back—litters for the
“<i>to be</i> wounded” and all. It was a glorious stampede—well
worthy of Bold Billy Jenkins.</p>

<p>[March] 16th. The next day we went out
[and] met Major Scott who went with G. W.
to [the] position afterward occupied by the six
gun battery—whilst I had a hole made through
the cemetery wall and broke into the chapel—hoping
to be able to reach the dome, and ascertain
from that place the direction of the streets. I
could not—we rather—get up to the dome, so we
left the cemetery, determining to push on toward
the town. G. W. found a very fine position for
a battery about 450 yards from Santiago and
enfilading the principal street. We met Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Totten and Captain [R. E.] Lee<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>—showed them
the place—they were very much pleased with it.</p>

<p>We came out with the Company (Captain Lee,
Smith, Foster and myself) that evening, arrived
at the place after dark, and Captain Lee, Smith
and Foster went in to lay out a battery—leaving
me, in command of the Company, in the road.
When on our return we were passing by the old
grave yard a sharp fire of musketry commenced—one
of our pickets had been fired upon.</p>

<p>The next day (17th) we cut a path to the
position of this battery (in perspective). As we
returned they discovered us and opened a fire of
24 pound shot upon us which enfiladed our path
beautifully. They fired too high and hit no one.
We reached at length a sheltered position where
we remained until the firing ceased—the balls
striking one side of the hill—we being snugly
ensconced on the other.</p>

<p>On the next day (18th) the position of the
batteries was definitely fixed. In the afternoon
I was ordered by Colonel Totten to arrange at
the Engineers’ Depot (on the beach) tools for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
a working party of 200 men—and be ready to
conduct it as soon as it was dark to the proper
position. The working party (3rd Artillery,
Marines, and 5th Infantry—all under Colonel
Belton) did not arrive until long after dark—and
it was quite late when we arrived at the position
for the batteries. I was placed in charge of
Mortar Battery No. 1—G. W. in charge of No.
2—a parallel was also made across the little valley.
Each of these batteries was for three mortars.
No. 1 was formed by cutting away the side
of a hill, so that we had merely to form the epaulments<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
and bring the terreplein<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> down to the
proper level—the hill sheltering us from the
direct fire of the Castle and Santiago. So also
with No. 2—which was made in the gorge where
the road to the cemetery crossed the ridge on left
of valley.</p>

<p>The tools for [the] working party were arranged
on the beach in parallel rows of tools for
20 men each and about four feet apart, so that
they might take up the least possible space. Each
man was provided with a shovel and either a pick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
axe, or hatchets (about 140 picks and mattocks).
The party was conducted in one rank, by the
right flank. The men were well covered by daylight.</p>

<p>[March] 19th. Mason, Foster, and I think
[I. I.] Stevens, relieved Captain Lee, Beauregard,
Smith and myself at 3 A. M. During the
day they continued the excavation of the two
batteries and the short parallel across the valley.
The enemy kept up a hot fire during the forenoon
but injured no one. During the evening of
this day Smith laid out and commenced the parallel
leading from No. 1 to the position afterward
occupied by the 24 pounder battery. The
work was difficult on account of the denseness
of the chaparral and the small number of workmen.
The parapet was made shot proof (or
sufficiently so to answer the purpose of covering
the morning relief) by daybreak. The enemy
fired grape etc. for a short time, but not sufficiently
well aimed or long enough kept up to
impede the progress of the work. The battery
known as the Naval Battery was commenced on
this same night. The enemy were kept in entire
ignorance of the construction of this battery until
the very night before it opened, and then they
only discovered that <i>something</i> was being done
there—they did not know what. The Mexican<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
Chief Engineer told Colonel Totten of this fact
after the capitulation.</p>

<p>[March] 20th. The construction of the parallel
and of the mortar batteries Nos. 1 and 2
was carried on during this day. By 3 P. M.,
when Mason and myself went out there—the
parallel was finished—the <i>excavation</i> of the two
batteries completed—the sandbag traverses in
No. 2 finished—those in No. 1 very nearly so.
We were to lay out and excavate the positions
for the two magazines of each battery, to commence
Mortar Battery No. 3 (for four mortars),
lay the platforms and place the magazine frames—which
were to be brought out at night fall. By
the direction of Mason, I had the positions of the
magazines prepared and laid out before dark.
Colonel Totten came out and directed me to lay
out No. 3. I also laid out the boyau<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> leading
from <i>1</i> to <i>2</i>. Mason took charge of the magazines
<i>1</i> and <i>2</i> and directed me to take charge of
No. 3. I employed four sets of men on the battery
at the same time—one set throwing the earth
from the rear of the parallel upon the berm<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
second on the berm disposing of this earth
thrown on the berm—a third set working at the
rear of the battery, excavating toward the front,
these threw the earth so as to form slight epaulments,
and in rear. A fourth set were employed
in making the excavations for the magazines. A
very violent Norther arose which obliged me to
employ the first and second sets <i>in front</i> of the
battery—they excavating a ditch.</p>

<p>At daylight the parapet was shot proof and
the battery required about one hour’s digging to
finish it. Owing to some mistake the platforms
and magazine frames did not arrive until very
late and but little progress was made as far as
they were concerned. Had they arrived in time
all three batteries could have opened on the afternoon
of the 21st. The construction of the battery
on the left of the railroad [was] still progressing.
They fired rockets etc. at us during the
early part of the night.</p>

<p>[March] 21st. During this day not very much
was done—some progress was made with the six
gun battery—magazines, platforms, etc.</p>

<p>[March] 22nd. Not being aware of a change
in the detail I went out at 3 A. M. Found the
magazines of No. 2 finished, the small magazines
of No. 1 the same. Took charge of large magazine
of No. 1—whilst Mason was engaged with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
those of No. 3. About 8 [o’clock] was informed
of change of detail, went to camp and was requested
by Colonel Totten to go out to the
trenches “extra” and give all the assistance in
my power, since the General wished to send in
a summons to the town at 2 P. M. and open upon
them if they refused to surrender. I went out
and was chiefly occupied during the day in covering
the magazine of No. 1 with earth. This was
done under fire of Santiago and adjacent bastion,
which batteries having a clear view of my working
party made some pretty shots at us—striking
the earth on the magazine once in a while, but
injuring no one. At 2 P. M. we were ready to
open with three mortars in No. 1—three in No. 2—one
in No. 3.—seven in all.</p>

<p>The flag was carried in by Captain Johnston,
the enemy ceased firing when they saw it. Colonel
Bankhead<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> informed the Commandants of
Batteries 1 and 3 that the discharge of a mortar
from No. 2 would be the signal to open from all
the mortars. The flag had hardly commenced
its return from the town when a few spiteful
shots from Santiago at my party on the magazine
told us plainly enough what the reply had
been. Probably half an hour elapsed before a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
report from No. 2 gave us the first official intimation
that General Morales<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> had bid defiance to
us, and invited us to do our worst.</p>

<p>The command “Fire!” had scarcely been given
when a perfect storm of iron burst upon us—every
gun and mortar in Vera Cruz and San
Juan, that could be brought to bear, hurled its
contents around us—the air swarmed with them—and
it seemed a miracle that not one of the
hundreds they fired fell into the crowded mass
that filled the trenches. The recruits looked
rather blue in the gills when the splinters of shells
fell around them, but the veterans cracked their
jokes and talked about Palo Alto and Monterey.
When it was nearly dark I went to the left with
Mason and passed on toward the town where
we could observe our shells—the effect was superb.
The enemy’s fire began to slacken toward
night, until at last it ceased altogether—ours,
though, kept steadily on, never ceasing—never
tiring.</p>

<p>Immediately after dark I took a working party
and repaired all the damage done to the parapets
by the enemy’s fire, besides increasing the thickness
of the earth on the magazines of <i>No. 1</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
Captain Vinton was killed a short time before
dark near Battery No. 3 by a spent shell—two
men were wounded by fragments of shells near
<i>No. 1</i>. Shortly after dark, three more mortars
were put in Battery No. 3—making 10 mortars
in all. Captain [John] Saunders was employed
upon the 6 gun battery (24 pounders). He
revetted<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> it with one thickness of sand bags, all
of which fell down next morning. I brought out
from the Engineer Depot the platforms for this
battery during the night—the magazine frame
was brought out next day. The battery on the
left of the railroad [was] still progressing, under
the charge of Captain [R. E.] Lee, [Lieut. Z.
B.] Tower and [G. W.] Smith—who relieved
each other.</p>

<p>[March] 23rd. Firing continued from our
mortars steadily—fire of enemy by no means so
warm as when we opened on the day before. Our
mortar platforms were much injured by the firing
already. The 24 pounder battery had to be
re-revetted entirely—terreplein levelled. During
this day and night the magazine was excavated,
and the frame put up. Two traverses made—the
positions of platforms and embrasures determined.
Two platforms laid and the guns run in—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
embrasures for them being partly <i>cut</i>. One
other gun was run to the rear of the battery.</p>

<p>[March] 24th. On duty with Captain Saunders
again—could get no directions so I had the
two partly cut embrasures marked with sand bags
and dirt, and set a party at work to cover the
magazine with earth as soon as it was finished.
During this day the traverses<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> were finished, the
platforms laid, the magazine entirely finished,
and a large number of sand bags filled for the
revetments of the embrasures. The “Naval Battery”
opened today, their fire was fine music for
us, but they did not keep it up very long. The
crash of the eight-inch shells as they broke their
way through the houses and burst in them was
very pretty. The “Greasers” had had it all in their
own way—but we were gradually opening on
them now. Remained out all night to take charge
of two embrasures. The Alabama Volunteers,
who formed the working party, did not come
until it was rather late—we set them at work to
cut down and level the top of parapet—thickening
it opposite the third and fourth guns. Then
laid out the embrasures and put seven men in
each. Foster had charge of two, Coppée of two,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
and I of two. Mine were the only ones finished
at daylight—the Volunteers gave out and could
hardly be induced to work at all.</p>

<p>[March] 25th. Mason and Stevens relieved
Beauregard and Foster—but I remained. I had
the raw hides put on—and with a large party of
Volunteers opened the other embrasures. This
was done in broad daylight, in full view of the
town—yet they had not fired more than three
or four shots when I finished and took in the
men. The battery then opened. We then gave
it to Mexicans about as hotly as they wished.
We had ten mortars—three 68s, three 32s, four
24s, and two eight-inch howitzers playing upon
them as fast as they could load and fire. Captain
Anderson, 3rd Artillery, fired on this morning
thirty shells in thirty minutes from his battery
of three mortars (No. 1).</p>

<p>As I went to our camp I stopped at Colonel
Totten’s tent to inform him of the state of affairs—he
directed me to step in and report to
General Scott. I found him writing a despatch.
He seemed to be very much delighted and showed
me the last words he had written which were “indefatigable
Engineers.” Then we were needed
and remembered—the instant the pressing necessity
passed away we were forgotten. The echo
of the last hostile gun at Vera Cruz had not died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
away before it was forgotten by the Commander
in Chief that such a thing existed as an Engineer
Company.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<span class="smcap">Church at Camargo, seen from the Palace.</span></p>

<p>The superiority of our fire was now very apparent.
I went out again at 3 P. M.—met Mason
carrying a large goblet he had found in a
deserted ranch. Found Captain Lee engaged in
the construction of a new mortar battery for four
mortars, immediately to the left of No. 1—in the
parallel. There was a complete cessation of firing—a
flag having passed in relation to the consuls,
I think. The platforms of this battery were
laid, but not spiked down. A traverse was made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
in boyau between Nos. 1 and 2, just in front of
the entrance of the large magazine of No. 1, it
being intended to run a boyau from behind this
traverse to the left of the new battery. I laid
out a boyau connecting Stevens’s communications
with the <i>short</i> “parallel” of No. 2, then Captain
Lee explained his wishes in relation to the new
battery and left me in charge of it. I thickened
the parapet from a ditch in front—inclined the
superior slope <i>upward</i>, left the berm, made the
traverses, had the platforms spiked, etc. The
mortars were brought up and placed in the battery
that night. Captain Saunders sent me to
repair the embrasures of the 24 pounder battery—doing
nothing himself. He then sent me to
excavate the boyau I had laid out.</p>

<p>About 11.30 the discharge of a few rockets
by <i>our</i> rocketeers caused a stampede amongst
the Mexicans—they fired escopettes and muskets
from all parts of their walls. Our mortars reopened
about 1.30 with the greatest vigor—sometimes
there were six shells in the air at the same
time. A violent Norther commenced about 1
o’clock making the trenches very disagreeable.
About three quarters of an hour, or an hour after
we reopened we heard a bugle sound in town. At
first we thought it a bravado—then reveillé, then
a parley—so we stopped firing to await the result.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
Nothing more was heard, so in about half
an hour we reopened with great warmth. At
length another chi-wang-a-wang was heard which
turned out to be a parley. During the day the
terms of surrender of the town of Vera Cruz<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
and castle of San Juan de Ulua were agreed
upon, and on 29th of March, 1847 the garrison
marched out with drums beating, colors flying
and laid down their arms on the plain between
the lagoon and the city ... muskets were
stacked and a number of escopettes ... pieces
of artillery were found in the town and ... in
the castle.</p>

<p>After the surrender of Vera Cruz we moved
our encampment—first to the beach, then to a
position on the plain between our batteries and
the city. Foster was detached on duty with the
other Engineers to survey the town and castle.
Smith and myself were to superintend the landing
of the pontoon and engineers trains, and to
collect them at the Engineer Depot. Between
the Quartermasters and Naval Officers this was
hardly done when we left. I dismantled the batteries,
magazines etc.—then amused myself until
we left, with the chills and fever.</p>

<p>J[immie] S[tuart] being too sick to go on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
with his regiment came over to our camp and
stayed with us. Instead of being sent on in our
proper position, at the head of Twiggs’s Division,
we were kept back and finally allowed to start
on the same day that Worth started<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>—we received
no orders to move, merely a permission.
Our teams (6) were the worst I ever saw—they
had just been lassooed as they swam ashore, and
neither they nor their teamsters had ever seen
a wagon before. We left Vera Cruz on the 13th
[April]. By dint of applying some of the
<i>knowledge</i> I had acquired under Guy Henry’s
parental care, I succeeded in getting four teams
to Ve[r]gara (Twiggs’s headquarters during the
siege). As Smith and Foster did not come up
I rode back to see what was the matter and found
that they had arrived at a point opposite the
middle of the city, broken down two sets of
teams, got one teamster’s arm and hand badly
kicked—and the devil to pay in general. At last
they got on, and by leaving half the loads by the
roadside we managed by hard swearing to get
to within one-half mile of El Rio Medio by dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>The road so far was horrible, being hilly and
very sandy. Our mules were so weak and miserable
that the men actually had to push the wagons
along, and it was easy to see that our march
was to be very severe upon all concerned. General
Worth and his staff passed us as we were
busily engaged in “cussing” a team up a hill—we
then learned for the first time that Santa
Anna was at Cerro Gordo with a large force.
When we encamped this night everybody was
tired to death, and the only event worthy of recollection
was the thrashing that a certain lazy
nigger “Isaac” received from his frisky “bos.”</p>

<p>On the [14th] we made an early start and after
“persuading” the mules up the hill beyond Rio
Medio we got along without very much trouble
until we arrived at Santa Fé. Here the wagons
were unloaded and leaving me with about ten
men Smith and Foster went back after the loads
left at Ve[r]gara. Jimmie [Stuart] and I struck
up an acquaintance with the Alcalde—a very nice
sort of a man. I found a couple of cavalry barracks
etc. We amused ourselves chatting with
the Alcalde all day—who tried hard to stampede
us with guerilla tales etc. Captain Hughes came
up late in the afternoon, Smith arrived after dark,
having left the wagons with the ordnance people
about half a mile behind. While G. W. [Smith]
was at supper, Jimmie, who had been amusing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
himself by playing monte with the Rancheros,
came back and amused us by an account of a
<i>muy poquito muchachito</i> [a very little boy] about
four years old playing monte and smoking paros
[<i>puros</i>, or cigars].</p>

<p>Foster came up at last, and we all turned in.
Santa Fé is a poor little affair—no water, but
rather a fine view of a large extent of rolling
country.</p>

<p>On the 15th I started back after the wagons
before daybreak “unwashed and uncombed.”
After a vast amount of swearing at “Seven Bottles,”
of whom more anon, I got all the wagons
up to Santa Fé—set the men to work at loading
the wagons—got my breakfast, and at last we
started. Country at first a rolling prairie—finally
more broken and woody. We passed some
of the most magnificent forests I ever saw—trees
covered with most beautiful flowers—the
fields also—the villages were completely deserted.
About the middle of the day we stopped at a
stream to rest.—While taking our lunch under
the bridge an old stupid Dutch teamster brought
down his mules to water and finally proceeded
to water himself. He drank seven (!) claret
bottles full of water and at length finding that
process too slow he <i>took to his bucket</i>! We went
on and overtook the ordnance fellows at .......<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Had a good supper and a fine sleep, although
they did try to stampede us about Lancers etc.—but
they could not do it.</p>

<p>Started early on the 16th [April]—country
remarkably broken—even mountainous. We
passed several very long hills, at which it was
necessary to treble our poor little teams. Met
Simon Buckner<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> with a beef party. Arrived
at Puerto Nacional just before Worth’s Division
left it (about 2 P. M.). Saw all the fellows and
made our preparations to start at twelve at night.
Took a fine bath in the clear mountain stream,
and then dinner. After dinner we went to see
Santana’s Hacienda—found a little boy in it who
was frightened to death at the Barbarians. A
réal [a small coin, about 12½ cents] soon quieted
him.</p>

<p>The bridge has a curved axis—it is a beautiful
piece of architecture. It would be impossible to
cross it were the heights around properly defended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
and the bridge itself occupied. The
bridge and heights might all be turned by enterprising
light infantry, for the stream is fordable.
From the nature of the ground it would be impossible
for artillery or cavalry to turn it without
<i>great trouble and labor</i>.</p>

<p>Reveillé at 11.30—started at quarter past
twelve—of course no undressing. S[tuart]
“thought as he was already dressed there could
be no hurry.” Night pitch dark. About an
hour before daybreak found in the road a saddle
(American) and a pool of blood—some poor
devil of a straggler from Worth’s Division probably
murdered. After ascending the hill just
beyond this spot, G. W. [Smith], J. S[tuart]
and myself laid down in the road to sleep—that
half hour’s sleep just before going into battle
was the sweetest I ever enjoyed. Passed in the
course of the morning a great many stragglers
from Worth’s Division—they had lagged behind
in the night march. About two miles from Plan
del Rio we were sitting in a ranche waiting for
the wagons, when a wagonmaster came galloping
by saying that the Lancers had cut off the
train. The escort of dragoons was about 800
yards nearer Plan del Rio than we. We galloped
back—the escort not far behind and found
that our wagons were safe, but that the Lancers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
had cut off a few of the stragglers whom we had
passed.</p>

<p>Suddenly a turn of the road displayed Plan
del Rio<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> at our feet—the little valley filled with
troops, horses, artillery, wagons, etc. We arrived
at about 10.30 A. M.—found the Engineers
and took a lunch with them. G. W. S[mith]
and myself then rode out to Twiggs’s position
with Captain Lee—we arrived just in time to
see the ball open [i. e., the battle of Cerro
Gordo]. Saw old Twiggs, who wondered
“Where the devil did you two boys come from?”
and started back to bring up the company. On
the way back a round shot came about as near
my head as would be regarded agreeable in civil
life and then missed enfilading the 2nd Infantry
about a foot and a half. When we got back to
El Plan, I was ordered to join [Lieut. Z. B.]
Tower with ten men—to go with Gid Pillow and
the Mohawks.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Did my best that afternoon <i>to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
find out where we were to go in the morning but
none of them would tell me anything about it</i>.
G. W. left me ten of the best men in the company,
and took Foster and the rest with him to
report to General Twiggs. It seemed to be a
mutual thought that the chances all were that
we would not meet again! The idea of being
killed by or among a parcel of Volunteers was
anything but pleasant.</p>

<p>Got up before daybreak—woke up the men—had
the mare fed and saddled—drank some coffee—distributed
tools to my party and was ready
for battle long before our dear Mohawks had
their breakfasts. Also gave some tools to the
Volunteers. My men had hatchets, axes and
billhooks—the Volunteers [had] axes, sap-forks
and billhooks. At length all was ready and much
to my surprise we marched straight up the road
toward Jalapa. So little did I know of our
point of attack—I only knew that we were to
attack either their right or front, and that we
would as surely be whipped—for it was a Volunteer
Brigade. I led off with my detachment,
and after passing the greater part of Worth’s
Division—which was formed in column of platoons
in the road—we turned off to the left,
nearly opposite the point where Twiggs turned
to the right. Tower directed me to place my men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
on the path inclining <i>most to the left</i>. I did so
and rested my men, whilst waiting for the Volunteers
who were a long distance behind. At
length General Pillow came up, and seeing my
men, directed that they should be placed on the
path <i>inclining to the right</i>.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tower made some remark about
changing the route, and also that we would be
more apt to be seen when crossing some ravine
if we went to the right. I remember distinctly
that the impression made upon me by the conversation
was that General Pillow had against
the opinion of Lieutenant Tower changed the
<i>route to be followed</i> in order to attain the point
of attack. I had no idea of the importance of
the change and that it could lead to a different
point of attack. I afterward found that the
different paths led to very different parts of the
enemy’s position, the one we actually followed
bringing us in a very exposed manner against
the front of the works, whilst if we had taken the
one advised by Lieutenant Tower we should have
turned the right of their works and have been
but little exposed to their fire.</p>

<p>The fault of the erroneous selection was General
Pillow’s, except that Lieutenant Tower
should, as the senior Engineer with the column,
have taken a firm stand and have forced General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Pillow to have pursued the proper path. It was
certainly a fine opportunity for him to show what
stuff he was made of—but unfortunately he did
not take advantage of it at all.</p>

<p>We at length moved off by the flank. My detachment
[was] at the head, and during the
movement—at all events before the firing against
us commenced—we heard the musketry of the
attack of Twiggs’s Division upon the Telegraph
Hill.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>After moving about two-thirds of a mile from
the main road we reached a certain crest bordering
upon a ravine, whence a strong picket of
Mexicans was observed. Tower advised General
Pillow to incline his Brigade well to the right
in order to cross the ravine lower down and out
of view. The General directed Colonel [Francis
M.] Wynkoop<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> to countermarch—file twice to
the right and move upon a certain dead tree as
his point of direction (Colonel Campbell’s [1st]<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
Tennessee Regiment to support him). He was
then to form his men for the attack and charge
upon hearing a concerted signal from the rest of
the Brigade. Colonel [William T.] Haskell<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
at once commenced forming his Regiment in a
column of platoon, the flank of the column toward
the work. His men having straggled a
great deal this arrangement was attended with
some difficulty—the men being literally shoved
into their places one by one. Hardly two platoons
were formed when General Pillow shouted
out at the top of his voice—“Why the H—l dont
Colonel Wynkoop file to the right?” I may here
observe that we had heard very distinctly the
commands of the Mexican officers in their works.
This yell of the General’s was at once followed
by the blast of a Mexican bugle and within three
minutes after that their fire opened upon us.
The General may have shouted this before a
single platoon of Haskell’s was formed—but the
interval must have been very short, because
Wynkoop’s Regiment had not reached its destination
and had not formed there when the firing
commenced.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>When the Mexican fire opened Haskell’s Regiment
became at once “confusion worse confounded.”
Some of the men rushed toward the
works, many broke to the rear, very many immediately
took cover behind the rocks, etc. I at
once asked General Pillow for orders to proceed
“<i>somewhere</i>” with my detachment—for I had as
yet received no orders or directions from anyone
and was utterly ignorant of the ground. While
talking with the General—who was squatting
down with his back to the work—he was wounded
in the arm, upon which his aide, Lieutenant
Rains, appeared from somewhere in the vicinity
and they together went off to the rear, on the
run. I then went in amongst the Tennesseeans
and found at once that it was useless to attempt
doing anything there, as that Regiment (Haskell’s)
was utterly broken and dispersed and the
Pennsylvania Regiment, which was to support
them, had kept so well in reserve that they could
not be found. I then went over to the other side
of the ravine—the firing had by this time nearly
if not altogether ceased.</p>

<p>Upon arriving there I found Campbell’s Regiment
in pretty good order and <i>in good spirits</i>, the
Pennsylvania Regiment (Wynkoop’s) in most
horrible confusion. Campbell was moving on
toward the work, and I at once advised General
Pillow to halt him until some order could be
restored to the other Regiments. He took my
advice and directed me to give the order to Campbell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
which I did. I thought that it was by no
means certain that Campbell alone could carry
the works and that if he were checked or repulsed
all was lost, for there was not a company formed
to support him. Besides, although his Regiment
was moving on well, they were not then under
fire, nor had they been under any fire, to speak
of, that day—so I doubted the steadiness of their
movements when their advance should have
brought them in sight and under the fire of, the
Mexicans.</p>

<p>Colonel Haskell came up without his cap about
this time and a very warm conversation ensued
between him and General Pillow—the General
accusing him of misconduct and deserting his
troops, the Colonel repelling his assertions and
stating that his Regiment was cut to pieces. I
at once, without saying a word to either the General
or the Colonel, called to my party and
directed them to beat the bushes for “2nd Tennesseeans”
and to bring all they could find to
where we were. They soon returned with quite
a number.</p>

<p>In the course of conversation I told General
Pillow that I did not think that he could carry
the works without some Regulars. He assented
and directed me to go at once in search of General
Scott and ask him, from him (Pillow) for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
a detachment of Regulars—whatever number he
could spare, saying that he would make no movement
until my return. I immediately ran down
to the road where I expected to find General
Scott and Worth’s Division and there found that
the General had gone on. I jumped on my mare
and galloped around by Twiggs’s road and at
length found the General about half way up the
ridge over which Worth’s Division passed to
reach the Jalapa road—the rear of Worth’s
Division was then crossing. I told the General
my message and he directed me to say to General
Pillow that he had no Regulars to spare, that the
last of Worth’s Division was then passing over,
that Santa Anna had fallen back with all his
army, except about 5000 men, toward Jalapa,
that he expected to fight another battle with
Santa Anna at once, and that he thought it probable
that the 5000 men cut off would surrender—finally
that General Pillow might attack again,
or not, just as he pleased. He evidently was not
much surprised and not much “put out” that
Pillow was thrashed, and attached no importance
to his future movements.</p>

<p>With this reply I returned, and could not for
a long time, find any of the valiant Brigade. I
at length found Wynkoop’s Regiment. He told
me that white flags were flying on the work and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
that one or two had come down toward his position—but
that as he did not know what they
meant, could not raise a white handkerchief in
the crowd, and had no one who could speak
Spanish, he had held no communication with
them. I told him what they meant and said that
when I had seen General Pillow I would return
and go to meet them. As I left he asked me if
I could not give him an order to charge—I said
“<i>No</i>”—then said he—“Tell General Pillow that
if I dont get an order to charge in half an hour,
I’ll be d—d if I dont charge anyhow”—this after
I had told him that the white flag meant a surrender!!!</p>

<p>I at length found General Pillow some distance
in rear and reported. Castor came up a moment
or two afterward and told General Pillow that
he had been sent to inform him that the Mexicans
had surrendered—on which I took my men down
the road and directing them to come on and rejoin
the company as soon as possible—I galloped
on to overtake it. During my conversation with
General Scott he mentioned that he had <i>seen</i> the
charge of Twiggs’s Division and spoke of it as
the most beautiful sight that he had ever witnessed.
He said everything in praise of his “rascally
Regulars.”</p>

<p>With reference to the operations of Twiggs’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Division.—During the afternoon of the 17th
[April] the hill opposite to and commanded by
the Telegraph Hill was carried by Harney’s
([Persifer F.] Smith’s) Brigade and the enemy
pursued partly up the Telegraph Hill by the
Rifles and 1st Artillery. They were, however,
<i>recalled</i> to the hill first mentioned, which was
occupied in force.</p>

<p>During the night one twenty-four pounder,
one twelve pounder and a twenty-four pound
howitzer were with great difficulty hauled up and
put in position behind a slight epaulment. There
were also a couple of the Mountain Howitzers
and some Rocketeers. Shields’s<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Brigade of Volunteers
were somewhere in the vicinity to support
and were employed to man the drag ropes
used to haul up the pieces. It may be well to
mention that they were more than once “<i>stampeded</i>”
while engaged in this by the mere discharge
of a piece—no ball coming near them.
Another detachment of New York Volunteers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
was engaged during the afternoon and night of
the 17th in hauling an eight-inch howitzer along
the crest on the other side of the “Rio” in order
to take an enfilade or reverse fire upon the Mexican
works. Taylor’s Battery was with Twiggs,
Dunean came around with Worth—Steptoe was
with Twiggs. The cavalry and rest of the artillery
were in the Jalapa road ready to advance
in pursuit.</p>

<p>Harney was directed to storm the hill, Reilly
to cut off the retreat of the Mexicans by the
Jalapa road—Worth to support. The affair of
the 18th was opened, on our side, by the fire of
our artillery. The 24 pounder was badly served
and did little or no real damage. At length
Harney charged over the valley with the 1st Artillery,
3rd and 7th Infantry, the Rifles being
thrown out to cover his left. He carried the hill
in gallant style. Reilly allowed himself to deviate
from his proper path and instead of pushing
straight on for the Jalapa road, he amused himself
by skirmishing to his right and left—so that
he did not accomplish the purpose for which he
was sent, that is, he <i>did not</i> cut off Santa Anna’s
retreat.</p>

<p>In the meantime Shields was sent around still
further to our right, to turn the Mexican left.
He finally came out in front of certain batteries,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
charged them but was <i>repulsed completely</i> and
himself badly wounded. About this time Harney
carried the Telegraph Hill and that commanding
these last batteries, one or two discharges
from its summit with the captured pieces at once
cleared them. Upon that the Volunteers right
gallantly charged and carried them at the point
of the bayonet, <i>there not being a soul in the battery
at this time</i>.</p>

<p>Twiggs—at least a part of his Division—moved
on at once in pursuit. The Cavalry soon
followed, but the Mexicans had gained a long
start and made the best use of their legs—so that
not very many were killed or taken in the pursuit.
Twiggs and the Cavalry also the Volunteers
halted at Encero. Worth remained at Plan
del Rio and Cerro Gordo. I myself overtook
my company at Encero where we bivouacked that
night—and felt right proud that we had won
that day a glorious victory.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 19th we marched from
Encero to Jalapa, about twelve miles, at the head
of Twiggs’s Division. We entered Jalapa about
11.30 A. M., our company being the first American
infantry to set foot in that city. It rained
quite violently during the greater part of the
march, which prevented me from enjoying fully
the beauty of the scenery, especially as I had to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
<i>foot it</i>. It was really delightful, upon entering
Jalapa, to see gentlemen and <i>ladies</i>, at least persons
dressed and appearing as such. The white
faces of the ladies struck us as being exceedingly
beautiful—they formed so pleasing a contrast to
the black and brown complexions of the Indians
and negroes who had for so long been the only
human beings to greet our sight. The Jalapiños
appeared perfectly indifferent about us, manifesting
neither pleasure nor sorrow at our approach.
Our march from Encero and entrance
into Jalapa was entirely undisturbed—not a shot
being fired or soldiers seen. Of course not the
slightest excess was committed by any of the
Regulars. We at first marched to the Cuartel
[Barracks] where we remained some few hours,
until at last we were ordered to a posada [sleeping
place] on the Plaza.</p>

<p>I was very much pleased with the appearance
of Jalapa and its inhabitants. The women were
generally pretty, the gentlemen well dressed.
They carried to a great extent the custom of filling
the balconies with flowers, which gave a very
pleasant appearance to the streets. Soon after
we had established ourselves at the posada we
were astonished by a great commotion in the
streets, which was ascertained to be caused by the
arrival of the Cerro Gordo prisoners, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
all been released on parole, and of course fought
us again upon the first opportunity. They were
marching back to Puebla and Mexico, organized
in regiments, etc.—merely being deprived of their
arms. The disgust in the Division at this release
was most intense, we felt poorly repaid for our
exertions by the release of these scoundrels, who,
we felt sure, would to a man break their parole.
They passed the night in the streets around the
Plaza and in the morning robbed all the poor
market women in the vicinity.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>We had no beds that night—our baggage not
being up—were lucky enough to get some frijoles
and chocolate for supper—breakfast ditto.
Worth’s Division came up about one o’clock on
the 20th and we were ordered on at the head of
it,—to leave Jalapa at 3.30 of the same day.</p>

September 22, 1846, McClellan wrote: “We start with
about 75 men—the best Company (so Gen’l. Scott and Col.
Totten both say) in the service. All Americans—all young—all
intelligent—all anxious, very eager for the campaign—and
above all, well drilled. If the Lord and Santa Anna
will only condescend to give us a chance—I’ll be most
confoundedly mistaken if we don’t thrash them ‘some’.”

“Legs.” He was born in Scott Co., Kentucky, on January
1, 1822. He died in New York on June 23, 1896. Smith
graduated from West Point in 1842. He entered the Confederate
Army in 1861 and distinguished himself in the
Peninsular Campaign fighting against his old friend at the
battles of Seven Pines and Fair Oaks.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> A letter from McClellan to his mother, dated “Camp
off Camargo, Mex.,” November 14, 1846, tells her that when
he arrived at Matamoros he was taken sick almost immediately.
He remained sick for two weeks while there and
“whilst on the steamboat thence to Camargo” ... “When
we got here I went into hospital quarters whence I emerged
yesterday, so that I have had almost a month’s sickness,
but now am perfectly well.” He adds, “I would not have
missed coming here for the world, now that I am well and
recovering my strength, I commence to enjoy the novelty
of the affair, and shall have enough to tell you when I return,
to fill a dozen books.” (<i>McClellan Papers</i>, Vol. I.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Later on McClellan wrote in the diary on a page otherwise
blank:</p>

<p>“On the 18th June, 1851, at five in the afternoon died
Jimmie Stuart, my best and oldest friend. He was mortally
wounded the day before by an arrow, whilst gallantly
leading a charge against a party of hostile Indians. He
is buried at Camp Stuart—about twenty-five miles south
of Rogue’s River [Oregon?], near the main road, and not
far from the base of the Cishion (?) Mountains. His grave
is between two oaks, on the left side of the road, going
south, with J. S. cut in the bark of the largest of the oaks.”</p>

Ireland, on January 12, 1792, died at Philadelphia, Pa.,
on August 7, 1881. Came to America early in life and
became a prominent merchant and Democratic politician
in Philadelphia. Served both in the War of 1812 and in
the Mexican War and in 1861 was mustered into the service
as a major-general. He commanded the troops in the
Shenandoah Valley and was outwitted by General Joseph
E. Johnston who slipped away in time to join Beauregard
and rout the Union forces under McDowell at the first
battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861. Patterson was retired
from the army the same month.</p>

on June 8, 1806. He died in Lee Co., Arkansas,
on October 6, 1878. Pillow was a prominent Tennessee
politician and was active in securing the presidential nomination
for his intimate friend James K. Polk. In 1846
he was commissioned a brigadier general by Polk and
went to the front in command of the Tennessee volunteers.
In 1861 he became a brigadier general in the Confederate
Army and is famous for having deserted his forces at Fort
Donelson on February 15, 1862, leaving them to be surrendered
to Grant the next day by his subordinate, General
Simon B. Buckner. Also see <i>Autobiography of Lieut.-Gen.

You never hear of a Mexican being murdered by a
regular or a regular by a Mexican. The volunteers carry
on in a most shameful and disgraceful manner; they think
nothing of robbing and killing the Mexicans.” Letter to
mother, dated “Camp off Camargo, Mex.,” November 14,
1846. (<i>McClellan Papers</i>, Vol. I.)</p>

<p>“I believe with fifteen thousand regulars, we could go
to the City of Mexico, but with thirty thousand volunteers
the whole nature and policy of the war will be changed.
Already are the injurious influences of their presence perceptible,
and you will hear any Mexican in the street
descanting on the good conduct of the ‘tropas de ligna,’ as
they call us, and the dread of the ‘volontarios.’ And with
reason, they (the volunteers) have killed five or six innocent
people walking in the streets, for no other object than
their own amusement; to-be-sure, they are always drunk,
and are in a measure irresponsible for their conduct. They
rob and steal the cattle and corn of the poor farmers, and
in fact act more like a body of hostile Indians than of
civilized whites. Their own officers have no command or
control over them, and the General has given up in despair
any hope of keeping them in order. The consequence is
they are exciting a feeling among the people which will
induce them to rise en masse to obstruct our progress, and
if, when we reach the mountains, we have to fight the <i>people</i>
as well as the soldiers, the game will be up with us. I have
some hope, however, that when we leave this place, which
has become a mass of grog-shops and gambling-houses,
and march to meet the enemy, the absence of liquor, and
the fear of the enemy, may induce a little order among
them and bring them to a better state of discipline.” Letter
of George G. Meade, dated Matamoros, July 9, 1846.
(<i>Life and Letters of General George Gordon Meade</i>, Vol. I,
pages 109-110.) Meade wrote further, from Camargo,
August 13, 1846: “Already have they in almost every volunteer
regiment reported one-third their number sick, and
in many cases one-half the whole regiment, and I fear the
mortality will be terrible among them, for their utter ignorance
of the proper mode of taking care of themselves.
The large number of sick is a dead weight upon us, taking
away so many men as hospital attendants, requiring quarters,
etc., and if taken sick on the march, requiring transportation
in wagons or on litters.” (Same, page 121.)
Also from Monterey, December 2, 1846: “The volunteers
have been creating disturbances, which have at last aroused
the old General [Taylor] so much that he has ordered one
regiment, the First Kentucky foot, to march to the rear, as
they have disgraced themselves and their State.... The
volunteers cannot take any care of themselves; the hospitals
are crowded with them, they die like sheep; they waste
their provisions, requiring twice as much to supply them
as regulars do. They plunder the poor inhabitants of
everything they can lay their hands on, and shoot them
when they remonstrate, and if one of their number happens
to get into a drunken brawl and is killed, they run over
the country, killing all the poor innocent people they find
in their way, to avenge, as they say, the murder of their
brother. This is a true picture, and the cause is the utter
incapacity of their officers to control them or command
respect.” (Same, pages 161-162.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> Meade, in a letter dated “Monterey, November 10,
1846,” wrote in explanation of this move as follows: “The
cabinet at Washington, profiting by the history of the Aulic
Council, is manoeuvering his (Taylor’s) troops for him,
and at Washington, entirely independent of his wishes and
views, organizing expeditions for Tampico, even going so
far as to designate the troops and their commanders. To-be-sure,
it is well understood how this is done, by the
mighty engine of political influence, that curse of our country,
which forces party politics into everything.</p>

<p>“General Patterson and others are good Democrats; they
are indignant that General Taylor should have left them in
the rear when he carried more troops than he could feed.
They complain at Washington, and forthwith General Patterson
and Co. are directed to proceed against Tampico,
and General Patterson informed before his commanding
general knows anything about it. Well may we be grateful
that we are at war with Mexico! Were it any other power,
our gross follies would have been punished severely before
now.</p>

<p>“General Taylor, of course, has to succumb, and the
Tampico expedition is to be immediately prosecuted. General
Patterson goes from Camargo.... He marches direct
to Tampico. General Taylor, however, does not design
that he shall have it in his power, from ignorance or other
causes, to fail; therefore he will leave here with a column
of some two thousand men and artillery, light and heavy,
and will join General Patterson before he reaches Tampico,
when both columns united, and under General Taylor’s
command, will operate against the town, in conjunction
with the navy, if the latter have it in its power to do anything.”

in chapters VIII and IX (pages 275-393) a lively account
of this same march, in which he took part, from Matamoros
to Victoria and Tampico. He describes many of the events
noted by McClellan, but from the standpoint of an enthusiastic
and self-confident member of the volunteer forces.</p>

<p>The contemptuous sting in McClellan’s frequent references
to “mustangs” can be appreciated from the following.
Says Furber (page 376): “The ‘mustang cavalry’—a description
of force unknown to the army regulations ...
accompanied us from Victoria.—It was composed of numbers
from the three regiments of infantry. Any one that
could raise the means to buy a long-eared <i>burro</i> (jackass),
or a mule, or old Mexican horse, or any such conveyance,
immediately entered the mustang cavalry. Such animals
could be bought for from three to five dollars. Some of
the riders had procured Mexican saddles, with their horsehair
housings and bridles also; while some had bridles, but
no saddles; others had saddles without bridles; while
others, again, had neither. Here was a soldier large as
life, with his musket in his hand, on a little jackass, without
saddle or bridle, and so small that the rider had to lift
his feet from the ground;—the little <i>burro</i> jogged along
with him, occasionally stopping to gather a bite of grass.”</p>

and attained a high and responsible position in the Spanish
administration of Mexico. In 1821 he advocated the celebrated
“Plan of Iguala,” in which it was proposed that
Mexico should become independent under the rule of a
member of the Spanish royal family. Ferdinand VII regarded
the movement as a rebellion, and Iturbide himself
was proclaimed emperor as Agustin I in May, 1822, and
crowned the following July.</p>

<p>A rebellion immediately broke out against his authority
under the lead of Santa Anna, who proclaimed a republic
at Vera Cruz. Iturbide was forced to abdicate in March,
1823, and went to Europe. He returned to Mexico the following
year but was arrested and shot at Padilla on July
19, 1824.</p>

to sit his horse sideways—with both feet on one side—particularly
on the battlefield.... Taylor was not a conversationalist,
but on paper he could put his meaning so
plainly that there could be no mistaking it. He knew how
to express what he wanted to say in the fewest well chosen
words, but would not sacrifice meaning to the construction
of high sounding sentences.” U. S. Grant, <i>Memoirs</i>,

On March 1, 1861, Joseph Holt, Secretary of War,
issued “General Order No. 5” as follows,—“By the direction
